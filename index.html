                <h1>Hello!</h1>
                <p>My name is <strong>Dawson Finklea</strong> and I am a Linux System Administrator, Programmer, and IP Network Technician.</p>
                <p>I am a recent graduate of the University of North Texas, where I earned my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.</p>
                
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I am originally from Houston and Galveston, Texas. From an early age I remember having a passion for computers.
                    When I was in elementary school, my classmates and I were given a creative writing assignment to use the website builder Weebly to
                    create a website for whatever we wanted. Me and my best friend went about creating a detailed site, advertising ourselves as the "Alpha Team", technicians
                    who were available, for free, to the entire school faculty, should they need assistance with any technical difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I suppose my fate was sealed then.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That same year, that same best friend took up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript">AppleScript</a>, Apple's scripting language
                    for their MacOS Automation system. I was encouraged to learn it as well, though I didn't get terribly far, it helped me
                    develop at an early age that necessary cognitive foundation for programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wasn't always sat in front of a computer though. Perhaps one of the strongest through-lines of my childhood was cycling. In 2008, my father founded
                    <a href="https://chainreactionbikes.org">Chain Reaction Ministries</a>, a volunteer organization based out of our local church at the time, which took in
                    donated bikes from the Houston community, repaired them, and donated them to homeless shelters and other low-income assistance organizations.
                    I spent 1 to 2 weekends out of every month working at the church repairing and riding bicycles with my friends, and other volunteers.
                    Ever since Hurricane Harvey displaced our family in 2017, and our church closed shop a few years later, we haven't been as active, but we still have a workshop,
                    a trailer, and a handful of bikes waiting to be put to good use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My father instilled in my his passion for cycling, so I spent a lot of time on the bike trails around Houston, and later on the Seawall in Galveston. I participated
                    twice in the MS150, a bicycle race from Downtown Houston to Downtown Austin.
                </p>
                <h2>Jack of All Trades</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout high school and college, my interests covered many different subjects across computing. I started using Linux regularly at the age of 16, and have since been
                    something of a homelabber, creating my own cloud storage, music streaming, web hosting, and VPN services. I also must have had nearly 5 different iterations of my personal website,
                    including this one. As the design of this site might suggest, I have a soft spot for the design language of user interfaces from days past, and frequently incorporate it into my work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my sophomore year, I attended Reykjavik University in a study abroad program, and the instruction there was a significant departure from the kind of work I had been doing
                    at UNT. I recieved some of the best instruction of my college career in the fundamental concepts behind Machine Learning, Cryptography, Networking, and Programming Language Design, 
                    and Computer Graphics, the knowledge from which I still find incredibly useful and relevant in my career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the latter half of my degree, I became interested in alternative home networking solutions after I encountered a number of people in my hometown of Galveston with wireless connectivity
                    problems. I can't say for sure what the reason was, but I suspect it was because of the nature of the construction of these historic homes. Thick, wooden walls and ceilings do not pass
                    UHF band radio frequencies well. Many of these older homes, however, had unused phone lines, or coax cabling run throughout the building. I knew that <i>someone</i> must have thought to
                    use these media to carry ethernet in the past, and sure enough, there were standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_over_Coax_Alliance"><b>MoCA</b></a>, or 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.hn"><b>G.hn</b></a>, or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePlug"><b>HomePlug</b></a> for using the building's power lines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, I've had one successful installation of a HomePlug system for a client in Galveston, and I hope to take advantage of these somewhat overlooked technologies to improve connectivity in places
                    where Wi-Fi functions poorly, and installing new runs of CAT5 cabling is infeasable.
