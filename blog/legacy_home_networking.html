    <h1>An Investigation of Legacy Home Networking</h1>
    <p>
        For the past century, people have let phone companies and cable television providers run new cables throughout
        their homes, and new construction will often include coax and phone lines by default. However, you rarely
        encounter homes, even new ones, with runs of CAT5 or CAT6 cable, and un-keyed 8P8C recievers in the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
        Natrually, the reason for this is that Wi-Fi has become the preffered standard for connecting devices in a
        home network. This makes sense for cell phones and laptops, but many people still have dedicated workstations,
        or smart TVs in fixed positions in their home, and relying on Wi-Fi for those devices is often an unnecessary downgrade.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think most people would expect devices that don't move to have the best connectivity, especially since those
        devices are likely to make up the bulk of the network demand. If your TV happens to be in an optimal position
        relative to your Wi-Fi router, perhaps you get good download speed, but I imagine many people are stuck
        with a TV that buffers all the time, because it's too far from the router, and there's no better place to put
        the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        This really shouldn't be an issue, but a proper fix would mean potentially thousands of dollars in installation
        costs for multiple runs of some twisted pair cable, and putting in proper network switch. For some, the cost
        and inconvenience might be worth it, but it certainly isn't for most people.
    </p>

        Various electronics manufacturers have identified this problem, and have come out with a great variety of
        communications standards and specifications that aim to leverage the existing cabling in a home; like coaxial,
        phone lines, and power lines.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here I cover some of these technologies, where they may be useful for a given application, and what considerations
        to make if you intend on using any of them.

    <h1>Powerline</h1>
    <p>I imagine that powerline ethernet adapters are the most well known out of this class of devices.</p>
    <p>
        The principle they operate on is simple. Powerlines normally carry only a 60Hz sine wave, with 120v potential to ground.
        A powerline ethernet adapter will impose an additional signal at a much higher frequency (4.5MHz to 21MHz), on those copper lines,
        and listen for signals of that frequency range coming from other devices. These signals are at such a low power level compared to AC
        power, that they have no impact on other devices plugged into other outlets.
    </p>
    <p>There is a catch, however.</p>
    <p>
        Powerlines are typically unshielded. They don't really need to be; no transmitted signal is going to be powerful enough to
        significantly affect the AC waveform. This is a problem for us, however, because signals picked up by the lines in our frequency range
        could very well interfere with our signal, slowing down transmission rates, or even stomp it out completely.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're lucky enough to live in a home where the wiring must be run through metal conduit, like those in Chicago, Illinois, your powerlines
        are ideal for this application, as metal conduit may largely shield the lines from electromagnetic interference.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other homes with thin interior and exterior walls, with only unshielded Romex running through the walls, may not fare nearly as well.

    <h1>Coaxial</h1>
    <p>The primary standard for ethernet over coaxial cables is MoCA, for "<b>M</b>ultimedia over <b>C</b>oax <b>A</b>lliance".</p>
    <p>Originally developed for distributing IP Television, MoCA is now a general-purpose ethernet link</p>
